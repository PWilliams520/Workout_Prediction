* ### Moving Average Code:

The simple moving average algorithm takes two parameters; a window and a list of observations. In our case these observations correspond to HR values. Next, we focus on a specific amount of observations at at time, this amount is dictated by our window parameter. We calculate the average of the observations within the window range and make that calculation our next prediction. Naturally, this window keeps moving until we have reached the end of our observation list and our full prediction set.

* ### Logistic Regression Code:

DMProject.ipynb

Please run the Jupyter notebook (DMProject.ipynb) to view the Logistic Regression model built for the dataset in activities.csv.


* ### Code for Graphs:

* ### Notes:

	* In order to run the code, execute the 'main.py' file. Make sure to have the 'activities.csv' file in the same directory. In order to change code behavior modify variables in the 'config.py' file accordingly.
